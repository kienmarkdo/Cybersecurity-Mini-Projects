# Beginner Cybersecurity Mini-Projects
As an absolute beginner in cybersecurity who has attempted some easy Capture-The-Flags (CTFs) challenges and TryHackMe labs, I decided to complete some easy cybersecurity projects to gain some hands-on experience.

Since this repository is a collection of several mini-projects, each directory represents a standalone project that are meant to perform a particular task. Mini-projects range from defensive to offensive cybersecurity, and cover a variety of fundamental concepts such as computer networking, cryptography, exploits, and more.

Some projects are implemented multiple times in different programming languages for learning purposes.

  <tr>
    <td><strong>RSA Algorithm</strong></td>
    <td>Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption algorithm from scratch.</td>
  </tr>

    <td><strong>Keylogger</strong></td>
    <td>A program that captures and records the user's keystrokes.</td>
  </tr>
  <!-- ===================================================== -->
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Network Sniffer (Packet Sniffer)</strong></td>
    <td>A basic network scanner that checks the number of devices connected to the user's local network and displays the devices' local IP addresses along with their MAC addresses.</td>
  </tr>
  <!-- ===================================================== -->
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Phishing Pages</strong></td>
    <td>An attempt to display oneself as an authentic source in order to steal the credentials of a victim. Opens a webpage and asks the user to enter their credentials. The entered credentials are then logged in a text file.</td>
  </tr>
  <!-- ===================================================== -->
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Steganography</strong></td>
    <td>Implements LSB steganography using the "stegano" Python library</td>
  </tr>
  <!-- ===================================================== -->
  <tr>
    <td><strong>SSTI</strong></td>
    <td>Emulates Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) using Flask. SSTIs are vulnerabilities that let the attacker inject code into server-side templates. Briefly, the attacker can introduce code that is processed by the server-side template, thereby resulting in remote code execution (RCE).</td>
